# Personal Website
This is my personal website I created using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The website serves as a platform for showcasing my skills, experience, and interests. It also serves as a project where I practice full stack development.

## Features
- Home: Introduce myself and provide an overview of my skills and interests.
- Experience: Display my work experience.
- Portfolio: Present a collection of my projects and links to view the code on GitHub.
- Reading List: Share the books I have read recently.
## Technologies Used
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- Express: Web application framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing my reading list.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for structuring and designing the website.
- Git: Version control system for managing code and collaboration.
- Deployment: Deployed frontend on Firebase and backend api for fetching reading list on Heroku.
